# WebGUI

This web based GUI is specific to the Paradigm Hyperloop Pod. 

It serves as the first point of interaction with the pod.

List of additions to make:
 - Finish creating buttons for necessary Pod Core function. 
 - More labels for new sensors being implemented in near future (MPYE Functionality).
 - Cosmetic updates along the way.
