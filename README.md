# WebGUI

This web based GUI is specific to the Paradigm Hyperloop Pod. 

It serves as the primary point of interaction with the pod and allows us to send commands to and receive data from the pod.

A secondary UI displays critical telemtry and sensor data has been created in Grafana and is used alongside this one to allow for quick analysis of all pod systems.

A tertiary UI with a 3D to-scale render of the pod has been created in Unity3D and is used alongside this one to show real-time visual representations of data: e.g. relative position of the pod in the SpaceX vacuum chamber.
