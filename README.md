# WebGUI

This web based GUI is specific to the Paradigm Hyperloop Pod. 

It serves as the first point of interaction with the pod and allows us to send commands to and receive data from the pod.

A Secondary UI displaying critical sensor data created in Grafana is used alongside this one to allow for quick analysis of all pod systems.

A Tertiary UI with a 3D rendering of the pod created in Unity3D is used alongside this one to show real-time representations of data: e.g. - relative position of the pod in the SpaceX vacuum chamber.
